## Installation and Setup

Assuming you have Node.js and npm or yarn installed:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd QuickConvert
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Frontend
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
